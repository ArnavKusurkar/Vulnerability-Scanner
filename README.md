# Vulnerability-Scanner
Here's a breakdown of what the code does step-by-step:

Imports:

It imports necessary libraries:
requests: Used to make HTTP requests to the specified URL.
BeautifulSoup from bs4: Used to parse and navigate HTML content.
Function Definition scan_url(url):

Input: Takes a URL as input (url parameter).
Process:
Attempts to make an HTTP GET request to the provided URL using requests.get(url).
Checks the response status code (response.status_code):
If the status code is 200 (successful), it proceeds to parse the HTML content of the response using BeautifulSoup.
It searches for all <form> tags within the parsed HTML (soup.find_all('form')).
For each <form> found, it prints "Form found:" followed by the details of the form.
It then searches within each <form> for all <input> tags (form.find_all('input')).
For each <input> tag found, it retrieves the name attribute using input_tag.get('name').
It prints "Input field:" followed by the name attribute value if it exists.
Error Handling:

Uses try-except to catch any exceptions that may occur during the HTTP request (requests.exceptions.RequestException) and prints an error message.
User Interaction:

Prompts the user to enter a URL (url = input("Enter the URL to scan: ")).
Execution:

Calls the scan_url(url) function with the user-provided URL.
Output:

For each form found on the webpage, it prints details about the form and each input field within that form.
